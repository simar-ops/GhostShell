When memory exhaustion occurs, the Linux kernel triggers a mechanism known as the OOM (Out of Memory) Killer to prevent the entire host system from crashing. This happens either because a container exceeds its specifically defined memory limit (hard limit) or because the host machine has completely run out of physical RAM and swap space. Unlike CPU pressure, which merely slows down a process through "throttling," memory exhaustion is terminal; the kernel identifies the "greediest" process using an internal scoring system and immediately terminates it using a SIGKILL (Signal 9). This is an abrupt shutdown that prevents the application from saving data or logging a graceful exit. You can typically diagnose this after the fact by checking the container’s exit code—137 is the "smoking gun" for an OOM kill—or by inspecting the host's system logs with dmesg, which will contain a kernel report detailing exactly which process was sacrificed to reclaim memory.
